# Gestion de stock

This file tries to describe the project guidelines.

## How to install ?

### `git clone https://github.com/Manjaka13/gestion-stock`

Clone this repo first

### `yarn install`

Install all dependencies

### Install prettier and eslint extensions for VSCode

Prettier is for formatting code, eslint for checking for errors and enforce code style. Reload VSCode once it's done.\
Now, each time you save a file, prettier is ran to format your code and eslint is ran to check for potential errors

**Note: Do not use npm, use yarn instead**

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Starts the app in development mode in the browser: [http://localhost:5000]

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
