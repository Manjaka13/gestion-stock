This file tries to describe the project guidelines.

## How to install ?

### `git clone https://github.com/Manjaka13/gestion-stock`

Clone this repo first

### `yarn install`

Install all dependencies

### Install prettier and eslint extensions for VSCode

Prettier is for formatting code, eslint for checking for errors and enforce code style. Reload VSCode once it's done.

**Note: Do not use npm, use yarn instead**

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Starts the app in development mode in the browser: [http://localhost:5000]

### `yarn build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
